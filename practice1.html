    <br>
I am currently a junior majoring in Computer Engineering at the University of Kansas.  My work experience includes being a Mathematics grader for the University of Kansas as well as a Computer Engineering intern at Peraton!  At Peraton I worked on a project building a testing fixture for a mail distribution machine that USPS uses.  Below is a picture of the testing fixture during the assembly process!
